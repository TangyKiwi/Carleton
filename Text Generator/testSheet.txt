By 2050, between 665,000 and 1.7 million people in the Pacific are expected to be
forced to migrate due to rising sea levels, including the entire populations of islands such as Fiji, the
Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu. 44, 45, 46 In larger countries, such as Bangladesh and the Netherlands, a
very large proportion of the population will probably be forced to relocate (46% and over 70%,
respectively). 47 By 2100, in the U.S. alone, barring a concerted mitigation effort, $238 billion to $507
billion worth of coastal property will likely be below sea level. 48 Some U.S. cities, including Miami,
Florida and Norfolk, Virginia, are in particular danger of inundation and increased flooding.
