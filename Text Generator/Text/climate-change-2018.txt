Climate Change in 2018: Implications for Business
[The Department of Defense] recognizes the reality of climate change and the significant risk it poses to U.S.
interests globally. The National Security Strategy, issued in February 2015, is clear that climate change is an
urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows,
and conflicts over basic resources such as food and water. These impacts are already occurring, and the scope,
scale, and intensity of these impacts are projected to increase over time.
The risk of large-scale climate change is one of the central issues facing the world. There is
widespread consensus among the scientific community that the Earth is warming, that this warming
is caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and that the consequences of continued
warming are likely to be severe. There is also global concern about the issue: in a recent Pew poll,
majorities in all 40 nations polled said that climate change was a serious problem, and a global median
of 54% said that it was a very serious problem.
But there is widespread disagreement about what—if anything—should be done in response. While
many economists believe that the benefits of reducing global emissions greatly exceed the costs, there
is only partial agreement as to what exactly should be done, how quickly it is appropriate to act, and
who should pay the costs. Some people, particularly in the United States, reject the scientific consensus
altogether. Others fear that many of the proposed solutions will be expensive and inefficient, or that
the free riding problems inherent in reducing emissions—namely, that everyone benefits while
particular nations, firms, or individuals must bear the costs—will make it impossible to substantially
reduce the risk of significant global climate change.
As a result, the risks of climate change—and the costs and regulatory changes that these risks may
drive—are emerging as central issues for the private sector. Some business leaders see climate change
as a threat to their firms’ viability. Others see opportunity in promoting technologies that will mitigate
the risk of climate change by reducing GHG emissions or by helping the world in adapting to its effects.
Some are actively lobbying against government action, while others are lobbying for industry, state,
and global carbon policies. This note attempts to summarize what is known about the causes, current
impacts, and likely future consequences of climate change; to outline the current debate about what
should be done; and to explore the implications for the private sector.

Writing Group)

The Earth’s average temperature has been increasing since the Industrial Revolution. Between 1880
and 2015, average global surface temperatures rose by 0.9°C (1.5°F) (Exhibit 1). 2 In 2016, the Earth
experienced its third consecutive hottest year since recordkeeping began. 3 There is broad consensus in
the scientific community that this warming has been largely driven by increases in atmospheric GHGs,
particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). (Emissions of GHGs are
often measured in equivalent units of CO2 emissions, or CO2eq, by indexing the 100-year global
warming potential of each gas to that of CO2.) 4 GHG emissions have been growing since the Industrial
Revolution and were 60% higher in 2014 than they were in 1990 (Exhibit 2). 5 Since 1880, atmospheric
CO2eq concentrations have risen from around 290 ppm to 430 ppm. 6
The primary sources of year-on-year GHG emissions are the “burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and
gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other
activities.” 7 Specifically, fossil fuel consumption for electricity and heat production generates about
25% of total GHG emissions; industry 21%; transportation 14%; other energy 10%; and buildings 6%;
while agriculture, forestry, and other land uses (AFOLU) contribute the remaining 24% of total GHG
emissions (Exhibit 3). 8, 9 In 2016, fossil fuels provided 81% of global energy supply—a trend that is
expected to continue (Exhibit 4). 10 Emissions vary widely across countries, and developing countries
are predicted to drive emissions increases going forward (Exhibit 5).
Higher levels of atmospheric GHGs raise temperatures by increasing radiative forcing, or the amount
of energy arriving on Earth’s surface (Exhibit 6). 11 Higher GHG concentrations increase the amount of
radiation caught by the atmosphere and redirected back toward the surface. The difference between
the rate at which energy arrives on the Earth’s surface and the rate at which it radiates back is the net
heating, with this heat accumulating at and below the surface of Earth’s oceans, land, and ice. Currently
the Earth retains approximately 816 terawatts of excess heat per year, or more than 50 times the world’s
entire energy consumption. 12, 13 Evidence of this retained heat is discernible in observations that
document Earth’s rising surface temperatures, warming oceans, and melting ice. 14
Nearly 200 nations have formally acknowledged in joint statements and international agreements
that human activity is responsible for global climate change, including the national academies of Brazil,
Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. 15 About
97% of climate scientists agree that human activity is causing climate change. 16, 17 Some observers claim
that climate change is not a man-made phenomenon, blaming factors such as solar cycles (variations
in the amount of energy reaching the Earth from the sun) or volcanic activity for recent increases in
temperature. 18 Others allege that scientists lack consensus or that global temperatures have cooled. 19
However, variations in the sun’s radiation are small relative to surface forcing associated with GHGs,
and the dominant 11-year cycle in solar output barely registers in global temperatures. In addition to
the changes in ocean, ice, and surface temperatures, the pattern of warming as a function of latitude
and elevation in the atmosphere allows for fingerprinting human-caused effects. 20 Climate skepticism,
in the sense of raising doubt about the fundamentals of the science, is more prevalent in the U.S. than
in other developed nations (Exhibit 7). 21 There is little debate about the reality of global warming
beyond U.S. boundaries, even amongst conservative political parties in nations such as Sweden
(Moderaterna), Canada (Conservative Party), the U.K. (Conservative Party), and Germany (CDU). 22
Predicting how GHG emissions are likely to evolve and the resulting changes in Earth’s temperature
is a complex undertaking, fraught with uncertainty. In response, the United Nations (UN)
Environmental Program and the World Meteorological Organization created the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988 “to prepare, based on available scientific information,
2


assessments on all aspects of climate change and its impacts, with a view of formulating realistic
response strategies.” 23, 24 Scientists are independently nominated for participation by their own
governments, and in 2016 over 2,000 scientists from 154 countries participated in the IPCC process. 25
By 2016, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere were 404 parts per million (ppm), the highest levels
in 400,000 years and up almost 7% since 2007 (Exhibit 8). 26 The IPCC’s states that, if no additional
efforts are taken to mitigate the effects of climate change, CO2eq concentrations are likely to increase to
approximately 450 ppm by 2030 and between 750 ppm and 1,300 ppm by 2100. 27 If this occurs, by 2100
the planet may experience global mean surface temperature increases of 3.7°C to 7.8°C (6.7°F to 14°F)
compared to pre-industrial levels. 28, 29 (See Exhibit 9.)
However, many scientists stress that such estimates are probabilistic and that temperature increases
could be either much greater or—perhaps—smaller (Exhibit 10). Most of the uncertainty involves the
upper estimates of possible warming, because temperature changes in response to increased radiative
forcing are bounded near zero on the low end but are essentially unbounded on the high end. The
reason for this asymmetric uncertainty is the presence of positive feedback loops. For example, global
warming reduces the amount of snow and ice covering Earth’s surface. Since snow and ice reflect more
sunlight back into space than does exposed land, this reduction further accelerates the rate of global
warming. 30, 31 Similarly, higher temperatures are causing the melting of the permafrost that covers 24%
of the Earth’s Northern Hemisphere. The permafrost contains an estimated 1,400 gigatons a (Gt) of
trapped carbon, between 33 and 114 Gt of which could be released by 2100 if the rate of thawing
continues, compared to a total of 850 Gt of carbon already in the atmosphere and anthropogenic carbon
emissions of about 10 Gt per year. 32, 33, 34, 35
One issue that concerns many scientists is that many of global warming’s impacts have unfolded
significantly faster than expected. For example, in 2007 the IPCC projected that global average sea
levels would rise 0.6 meters (2 feet) by 2100, but in 2013 the prediction was revised to as much as 0.98
meters (3.2 feet), and then in 2016 revised again to up to 2 meters (6.6 feet). 36 Similarly, the IPCC has
historically underestimated the pace of Arctic sea ice decline. In 2007, models predicted the first icefree Arctic summers could arrive nearly a century later, in 2100; but in 2012, the estimate was that this
would occur in only 20 to 30 years. 37 The actual pace of sea ice decline has turned out to be far quicker,
“exceeding the worst worst-case scenario predicted in the 2007 IPCC report.” 38 As of 2016, “[the] Arctic
is on track to be free of sea ice this year or next for the first time in more than 100,000 years.” 39

The Impacts of Climate Change
Rising GHG concentrations are expected to have a wide range of effects, including:

Rising sea levels As the world warms, sea levels rise, both because increasing temperatures
cause ice fields to melt and because the oceans themselves are warming (and therefore expanding).
Since around 1870, rates of global sea level rise (GSLR) have accelerated and are now about 3.5 mm
(0.15 inches) per year. 40 By 2100, sea levels are projected to rise by up to 2 meters (6.6 feet), depending
on GHG emissions and the effects of warming air and ocean water on ice (Exhibit 11). 41
Two thirds of the world’s largest cities are located in low-lying coastal areas, and increasing sea
levels could submerge the land on which an estimated 470 million to 760 million people are living. 42, 43
A number of island nations—including 11 of the Solomon Islands—are already submerged or at risk




of total destruction. By 2050, between 665,000 and 1.7 million people in the Pacific are expected to be
forced to migrate due to rising sea levels, including the entire populations of islands such as Fiji, the
Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu. 44, 45, 46 In larger countries, such as Bangladesh and the Netherlands, a
very large proportion of the population will probably be forced to relocate (46% and over 70%,
respectively). 47 By 2100, in the U.S. alone, barring a concerted mitigation effort, $238 billion to $507
billion worth of coastal property will likely be below sea level. 48 Some U.S. cities, including Miami,
Florida and Norfolk, Virginia, are in particular danger of inundation and increased flooding. 49

Changing weather patterns and extreme weather Although it is difficult to link any single
event directly to climate change, rising temperatures means that the atmosphere can hold more water
vapor, allowing both for greater rates of rainfall and runoff when the air is saturated and for drier
(more under-saturated) conditions otherwise. 50,51 In other words, though overall rates of evaporation
are not changing greatly, extremes in precipitation are becoming less frequent but more intense, and
as a result rainfall patterns are shifting across the world. 52 Since 2013, extreme drought has affected the
Western U.S. In California, 2015 was the driest year on record, supplanting 2013; and 2014 had been
the third-driest. 53, 54 Somalia, Kenya, and other East African countries have experienced below-average
rainfall since the late 1990s, contributing to a 30% reduction in crop yields and famines in 2010, 2011,
and 2016. 55, 56 There has also been an increase in the prevalence of hurricanes and other destructive
weather events. 57 For example, in 2013 the Philippines was hit by one of the worst typhoons in recorded
history (Typhoon Haiyan), which led to over 6,000 deaths, displaced nearly 4 million people, and
caused billions of dollars in damages. 58
Pressure on water and food Food production is tightly coupled with water availability. As
recently as 2014, just 16% of the Earth’s croplands were irrigated (as opposed to rainfed), but irrigated
lands produced 36% of global harvest. 59 As the Earth warms, the combination of shrinking glaciers,
reduced snowpack, and increasingly erratic rainfall raises fears of shortages, particularly in the world’s
most vulnerable regions. 60 Water shortages in Pakistan and India, for example, threaten the viability
of agriculture in the region. 61, 62 By 2030, overall demand for water may outstrip supply by 40%. 63 And
by the 2090s, without significant reductions in GHG emissions, the proportion of the global land
surface in extreme drought could increase from 1% to 3% today to 30%. 64 Global food production is
also affected by warmer temperatures, increased CO2 levels, and extreme weather events. 65 In some
cases, increased CO2 or warmer weather may accelerate crop growth or increase yields; however, yields
decline above an optimal temperature that varies by crop, and crops grown under high levels of CO2
yield less of nutrients such as zinc, iron, and protein. 66 Furthermore, warmer weather allows pests,
weeds, and parasites to thrive; extreme weather can be destructive to farmland, crops, and livestock;
and rising sea levels can erode and salinize croplands. 67, 68
Political and security risks Climate change has been linked to increased political instability
worldwide. 69 When food prices rose sharply in 2007-2008, dozens of so-called “food riots” caused
casualties in Argentina, Cameroon, Haiti, and India. 70 Both the Somalian civil war and the Syrian civil
war have been linked to drought and famine exacerbated by climate change. 71 The U.S. military has
suggested that climate change is “a salient national security concern,” which could redraw maps and
spheres of engagement while compounding conflicts and resource constraints in some of the world’s
already vulnerable countries, leading to further instability and even war. 72, 73 (See Exhibit 12 for a map
of major disaster-related displacements in 2014.)
Human health risks Higher temperatures increase the possibility of heat-related injury and
death. 74 As many as 70,000 people died in the 2003 European heat wave, and more than 50,000 died in
a 2010 heat wave in Russia. 75, 76 Thousands more have perished in increasing and increasingly severe
heat waves in India (2015), Europe (2006), and around the world. 77 Water- and vector-borne diseases




are also projected to increase as insects and other carriers move into higher latitudes. 78 For example,
between 2000 and 2013, instances of Lyme disease in the U.S. doubled. 79 A warmer atmosphere also
increases the concentrations of smog (a lung irritant), while continuing to burn fossil fuels—
particularly coal—can lead to millions of premature deaths. The burning of coal has been linked to tens
of thousands of premature deaths in the U.S. annually, and the World Health Organization found that,
in 2012, 7 million people worldwide died due to air pollution (Exhibit 13). 80
Studies conducted to quantify economically the health impacts of climate change have suggested
that the costs are substantial. According to research conducted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health, the extraction, transportation, processing, and combustion of coal in the U.S. cause
24,000 excess lives lost annually due to lung and heart disease (evaluated at $187.5 billion per year) and
11,000 excess lives lost annually due to high health burdens in coal-mining regions (evaluated at $74.6
billion per year). 81 Another study conducted by the EPA found that the health impacts of fossil fuel
electricity in the U.S. totaled between $362 billion and $887 billion per year (representing 2.5% to 6.0%
of GDP) due to premature mortality, workdays lost, and other direct healthcare costs. 82

Impact on wildlife and ecosystems Climate change also significantly affects many natural
habitats and puts many species at higher risk of extinction in the coming century. 83 Observing that
current extinction rates are 100 times the normal rate, some scientists predict that the Earth is headed
for the sixth mass extinction event in its history. 84, 85 By 2100, 30% to 50% of the world’s land and marine
animal species may be extinct. 86, 87 Climate change is also having significant effects on the oceans. Over
the last 100 years, it has raised near-surface ocean temperatures by about 0.74° C (1.3° F) and made the
sea significantly more acidic, likely affecting marine animals’ reproduction and survival. 88, 89, 90
(Exhibits 14 and 15.) In some places, live coral coverage is only half of what it was in the 1960s, and
scientists predict that the world’s coral reefs could be entirely extinct by 2050. 91, 92 As many as 1 billion
people rely on the fish that live in coral reefs as their primary protein source. 93

The discussion of what should be done in response to climate change is complicated by two distinct
but interrelated problems. The first is the sheer magnitude of the changes required to mitigate and/or
adapt successfully to climate change, and the second is the global free riding problem that impedes
consensus on who should pay for those changes.
There is general agreement in the scientific community that global warming needs to be limited to
2°C (3.6°F) above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century in order to avoid potentially
dangerous impacts. 94 This probably requires atmospheric concentrations of CO2eq, which in 2016 were
estimated to be around 430 ppm, to remain below 450 ppm. 95, 96 Keeping the Earth within the 2°C limit
thus requires urgent action (Exhibit 16). In general, reducing emissions requires action on three fronts: greatly increasing the efficiency with
which energy is used; “decarbonizing” the world’s energy system through the use of renewable energy

For all the comforting predictability implied by the graphs, charts, and proposals of international climate assessment reports,

if climate change unfolded as forecast under some CO2 emissions scenarios, no one really knows what would happen. Harvard
economist Martin L. Weitzman has argued that “the most striking feature of the economics of climate change is that its extreme
downside is non-negligible. Deep structural uncertainty about the unknown unknowns of what might go very wrong is coupled
with essentially unlimited downside liability on possible planetary damages.”




The Carbon Mitigation Initiative at
Princeton University suggests that it is useful to think about the magnitude of the changes that are
required in terms of “wedges,” where each wedge represents a carbon-cutting strategy that has the
potential to avoid 1 billion tons of carbon emissions per year by 2060, or about one eighth of what is
required to stabilize global emissions. The Carbon Mitigation Initiative presents a menu of 15 wedges,
including “cutting emissions by 25% in all new and existing residential and commercial buildings” and
“adding new nuclear electric plants to triple the world’s current nuclear capacity,” that if taken together
would keep emissions at or below levels seen in 2000 (Exhibit 17). 

Improvements in energy efficiency Reducing energy demand through conservation and
innovation appears to be a particularly promising means of reducing GHG emissions. For example,
between the mid-1980s and 2015, energy efficiency standards and labeling for appliances and a broad
range of products in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and other nations reduced the energy consumption of
these products by 10% to 25%. 98 In 2015, such measures saved consumers and businesses in the U.S.
about $40 billion. 99 A National Academies study concluded that while using LEED-Silver or equivalent
standards in the construction of new buildings increased the costs of initial construction by up to 8%,
energy costs would be reduced by between 5% and 30% over the life of the building. 100 A report from
the UN Foundation estimated that an investment of $3.2 trillion worldwide in energy conservation
would avoid new supply investments of $3 trillion and would pay for itself within three to five years. 101
Since most energy use occurs in cities with rising populations, policies that encourage residential
density, localized employment opportunities, diversified urban land use, and public transportation are
particularly important. 102 Behavioral changes can also have a tangible impact. For instance, McKinsey
estimates that changes such as driving smaller cars could reduce fuel demand by about 10% in 2030. 103
The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that around 40% of the reductions required by 2050
could potentially come from increased energy efficiency. 
Keeping GHG concentrations in the atmosphere below 450
ppm requires either the development of the ability to capture CO2 directly from the atmosphere at scale
and/or moving away from coal, natural gas, and oil toward hydro, nuclear, solar, and wind power. 105
In 2014, the world used an average of 16 to 18 terawatts (TW) of power at a given moment. c About
28.6% of this energy was supplied from coal, 31.1% from oil, 21.2% from natural gas, and 4.8% from
nuclear. 106 Biofuels and waste made up 10.3%, hydro 2.4%, and “other” renewables—geothermal,
solar, wind, etc.—made up 1.4%. 107 Despite its tiny market share, solar energy has been frequently cited
as a promising contender to fossil fuels. A key reason is that the experience curve (or learning curve)
of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules has been shown to be about 20%, meaning that the price per module
drops by about 20% every time the cumulative production of PV modules doubles. 108
Are solar and wind energy already competitive against fossil fuels today? In some parts of the
world, at some times of day, the answer is almost certainly yes. In 2015, the average retail price of
electricity was $0.1267 per kWh for residential, $0.1059 per kWh for commercial, and $0.689 per kWh
for industrial customers. 109 In areas such as the Southwest U.S. and North Africa, unsubsidized utilityscale solar PV can cost between $0.05 per kWh and $0.07 per kWh. 110 The cost of land-based wind
power declined from $0.55 per kWh in 1990 to between $0.04 and $0.06 per kWh in 2016 (Exhibits 18
and 19). 111 Some analysts believe that wind is currently the cheapest source of power in about one third
 A note about “watts” (W) versus “watt hours” (Wh): The watt is a measure of power, or the rate at which energy is generated

or consumed. For example, the Three Gorges Dam has a power-generating capacity of 22,500 megawatts (MW). The watt hour
is a measure of the amount of energy. The annual energy output of power stations is given in this measurement. For example, in
2014 the Three Gorges Dam generated 98.8 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. When a light bulb with a power rating of 100 W
is turned on for one hour, the energy used is 100 Wh or 0.1 kilowatt hours (kWh).



of the US. 112 Moves toward increased use of solar and wind are complicated by the fact that, as of 2016,
neither solar nor wind can provide baseload (or continuous) power. 113 Deploying wind and solar at
scale thus requires significant advances in energy storage and the development of a smart grid to
redirect excess power over long distances. 114 Opinions differ as to how soon this will be feasible and
how much it will cost, but some analysts believe that it is likely the U.S. will be able to decarbonize its
energy system by 2050 (Exhibit 20). 
Expanding nuclear power is another option, in particular through the accelerated diffusion of so
called “fourth generation” nuclear power: recent developments hold the promise of significantly
reducing the capital costs associated with building nuclear power reactors while also making them
safer and reducing their waste production. 115 In addition, transportation is responsible for 26% of U.S.
CO2 emissions, making it the second largest source behind electricity (30%). 116 Efforts to reduce
emissions from the sector include substantial investments in both biofuels and electric vehicles.

Changes in agricultural, forestry, and other land use practices Changes in land use also
have the potential to be an important factor in reducing carbon emissions. 117 For example, from 2000
to 2005, the burning of tropical forests accounted for 7% to 14% of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions. 118
Because forests act as sinks that remove carbon from the atmosphere and place it in the ground, the
destruction of those forests accelerates the pace of climate change. 119 Biochar—charcoal added to soil
to enhance crop yields and nutrition—is one potential means of reducing GHG emissions while
simultaneously improving soil health. 120 Rather than burning agricultural and forestry waste, a source
of enormous GHG emissions, waste biomass could be converted to biochar, which stores carbon in soil
for thousands of years. 121 Other changes in agricultural practices aim to reduce methane emissions
from livestock, which account for 14.5% of global CO2eq emissions. 122 One possible solution is the use
of feed additives, which could reduce these emissions by 25% to 30%. 123 The U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization estimates that changes in practices “within existing [livestock agriculture] production
systems could cut agricultural emission by about 30%.” 124
Geoengineering Some scientists claim that geoengineering, or intentionally interfering in the
world’s climate systems, is a possible solution to mitigating climate change. 125 They suggest exploring
possibilities like injecting sulfates into the atmosphere, where their high reflectivity would stop up to
1% of the sun’s radiation from reaching the Earth’s surface. 126 One plan in the U.K. involves pumping
“water nearly a kilometer up into the atmosphere, by way of a suspended hose” attached to a “stadiumsize hydrogen balloon” in the stratosphere, 20 km above the Earth. 127 The plan, called Stratospheric
Particle Injection for Climate Change (SPICE), is meant to test the feasibility of one day spraying sulfate
particles in place of water. 128 SPICE and other geoengineering ideas were inspired by studying the
atmosphere-cooling effects of volcanic eruptions, such as the Mount Pinatubo, Philippines eruption of
1991, which “spewed 20 million tons of sulfate particles into the atmosphere, cooling Earth by 0.5
degree Celsius for 18 months.” 129, 130 Preliminary estimates suggest that geoengineering could be
relatively cheap, although it would have to be maintained continuously in order to control the Earth’s
temperature. 131 However, this suggestion is hugely controversial. There are concerns that we have very
little understanding of what the widespread distribution of sulfates might do and fear that they will
damage the ozone layer, lead to drought, and possibly “disrupt the Asian and African summer
monsoons, reducing precipitation to the food supply to billions.” 


The Debate: Who Should Pay and How Much Should Be Spent
At the highest level, several studies suggest that the costs of mitigating the effects of climate change
are likely to be much lower than the costs of leaving it unchecked. For example, the IPCC estimated
that keeping GHG emissions to a level that offers a 66% chance of not exceeding 2°C warming would
cost 3% to 11% of world GDP by 2100, while leaving global warming unchecked might cost 23% to 74%
of global per capita GDP by 2100 in lost agricultural production, health risks, flooded cities, and other
major disruptions. 
One approach to this question is through attempts to calculate the “social cost of carbon” (SCC), a
measure designed to capture the economic damages caused by carbon emissions and usually expressed
as an estimate of the damages caused by burning one ton of carbon. SCC values project the impact of
carbon emissions far into the future, so they are sensitive to discount rates and to assumptions about
how climate damages are likely to unfold. In 2015, the U.S. government estimated that the SCC was
$36 per metric ton of CO2., using a discount rate of 3%(Exhibit 21). 135 This value suggests, for example,
that the social costs of burning coal are significantly greater than the entire coal industry’s revenues.
The two most common types of coal in the U.S. cost $14.72 and $55.99 per ton at the mine, respectively;
and each ton of burnt coal emits 1.7 t and 2.2 t of CO2, respectively. 136, 137, 138
The International Monetary Fund concluded that in 2013, fossil fuels caused $1.1 trillion in
environmental and economic damages from climate change (1.5% of world GDP) and $2.2 trillion in
health damages from pollution (3% of world GDP). 139 In the U.S. alone, fossil fuels led to $186 billion
in climate change damages and $180 billion in pollution damages (each 1.1% of U.S. GDP). 140, 141 (In
2010, the U.S. spent over $800 billion on coal, natural gas, and petroleum.) e, 142
The fact that the benefits of addressing the problem of climate change almost certainly outweigh
the costs—and that the effects of increased emissions are likely to last for thousands of years and affect
the wellbeing of billions of people yet to be born—does not make concerted global action to address
the problem easy. Indeed climate change is a difficult problem because addressing it requires dealing
with (at least) three thorny issues: discount rates, free riding, and global geopolitics.

Discount rates How much do we value GDP 100 years in the future? If we apply a discount rate
based on the conventional cost of capital of 7% to 8% the answer is “not very much.” For example,
$1,000 discounted at 7% for 100 years is worth only $1.15 in 2016 dollars. Many have argued that this
is the wrong calculation and that it cannot be correct to place essentially no value on the wellbeing of
our children's children, but there is enormous debate about how fast it makes sense to attempt to
respond to climate change. 143 Analysis is complicated by the potential for technologies to become much
cheaper in the future, just as solar panels have, and by the fact that climate change is already having
major economic impacts. Hurricane Irene, for example, the storm system that hit New York City in
2011, caused around $15 billion or more in damage. 144 The costs of the Syrian conflict are plausibly
many times that, not to mention the loss of life of hundreds of thousands of people.
Free riding Even given general agreement among nations that the costs of inaction outweigh the
costs of action, addressing climate change still requires solving the free riding problem, or the fact that
while the costs of reducing emissions must be incurred by particular firms, cities, or nations, the
benefits will be experienced by everyone on the planet. GHG emissions are a classic “externality”: their

This estimate included expenditures in the residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors but did not include

expenditures on retail electricity or biomass.





emission imposes harm on the entire community, but the emitters themselves—absent some form of
cooperative agreement or global regulation—have no incentive to reduce them. 

This issue is further complicated by the fact that many of the countries that
are most vulnerable to climate change—primarily poorer developing nations—are those with relatively
small historical carbon footprints. Many of them argue that the countries whose cumulative actions
have contributed most to climate change, the developed nations, should bear most of the responsibility
for cutting emissions. 146 This has proved to be a controversial idea, particularly as developing
countries’ emissions have increased rapidly in line with their economic growth. Many developing
countries have chosen to pursue cheaper but more GHG-intensive energy sources such as coal-fired
power plants to foster development. 147 Some experts believe that some developing countries may be
able to “leapfrog” traditional energy-intensive development paths. 148
Despite these formidable difficulties, the global community has been experimenting with a variety
of mechanisms to address climate change. It is widely believed that the most effective way to reduce
carbon emissions is to rely on market based mechanisms such as carbon taxes and/or cap and trade
regimes. 149, 150 Cap and trade systems issue permits that allow companies to emit a certain amount of
GHGs; those companies that emit less than their initial allotments are then allowed to sell their excess
permits to companies that wish to emit more than their initial allotment. The U.S. Acid Rain program
relied on a cap and trade mechanism and succeeded in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by 40%
and acid rain by 65%. The estimated benefits of the program were $56 billion compared to costs of just
$558 million. 151, 152, 153 In contrast, a carbon tax places a predetermined price on every ton of CO2eq
emitted into the atmosphere. 154 An EIA study found that total U.S. emissions could fall by four fifths
by 2040 if the U.S. imposed a $25 per ton carbon tax in 2014 and raised it by 5% every year. 155 Both cap
and trade systems and carbon tax programs seek to shape behavior by presenting the “real” external
cost of emissions to firms and consumers. 
The first attempt to implement a global cap and trade regime to reduce GHG emissions was
embodied in the Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted in 1997 and took effect in 2005. 157 The agreement
mandated that developed countries reduce their overall GHG emissions to 5% below their 1990 levels
between 2008 and 2012. 158 The Kyoto Protocol appears to have contributed to significant emissions
reduction in the European Union but was never ratified by the U.S. and did not impose any obligations
on developing countries such as China and India. 159 More recently, annual UN climate change
conferences have brought together world leaders to review and extend the Kyoto commitments, with
varying results. In 2015, 195 countries signed an agreement at the Paris Climate Conference (also
known as COP21). It was the first commitment by nearly all of the world’s nations to take steps to curb
GHG emissions and keep temperature increases “well below” 2°C.
In the absence of binding global commitments, some states and regions have experimented by
imposing their own carbon taxes and cap and trade regimes. Norway introduced a countrywide carbon
tax in 1991. 161 Australia instituted a carbon tax in 2012 but repealed it the following year. 162, 163 A
consortium of states including Connecticut, New York, and Massachusetts set up a cap and trade
regime titled the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. 164 One study found that the program produced
$1.6 billion in net value added and $16.1 billion in increased employment between 2009 and 2011. 165

Regulations that seek to directly shape behavior by mandating the use of energy efficient appliances can be effective tools for

reducing energy consumption or supporting a shift to lower carbon fuels. Many studies have explored the conditions under
which this is likely to be the case. Source: “Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2006,” World Meteorological Organization,





California introduced a cap and trade system in 2013. 166 The Canadian province of British Columbia
instituted the only North American carbon tax in 2012. 167 The tax, which was designed to be revenue
neutral, brought in $1.1 billion in 2013. 168 The tax has not had an adverse effect on the province’s
competitiveness in the agriculture sector, although industries like cement manufacturing may have lost
business. 169 In December 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada announced plans to introduce
nationwide carbon pricing in 2018, which would set a minimum price of about $7.60 per metric ton on
fossil fuels that would increase to $38 per metric ton in five years. 
A number of countries have experimented with a range of other policies designed to reduce
emissions. Many have offered subsidies to offset the costs of developing and producing renewable
energy, such as simple lump-sum rebates or grants typically provided at the beginning of a project.
Such policies can help to level the playing field as many countries also continue to provide fossil fuel
subsidies. 171 For example, in 2015 China led the world with $103 billion in renewable energy
investments, 36% of the world’s total, 172 and in the same year over 20% of China’s energy generation
came from renewable sources. 173 Many American states have imposed renewable portfolio standards,
mandating that a certain proportion of electricity supply must be generated from renewable sources. 174
Congestion charging has led to significant reductions in car usage in places such as Singapore, London,
and Stockholm. Tax credits have been used to incentivize investments such as renewable energy
projects or residential efficiency improvements; and performance standards mandating the use of
lower-energy technologies are found in many countries (Exhibit 22). 

Implications for the private sector
The challenge of climate change presents both wide-ranging threats and opportunities for the
private sector. On the one hand, public support for some form of carbon regulation appears to be quite
strong (Exhibit 22), and government action to mitigate climate change poses a significant threat for
some firms. The immediate effects of climate change are already threatening the viability of existing
business practices in agriculture, infrastructure, and construction. But climate change also opens up
opportunities. For example, 45% of consumers are willing to pay more for a product “from a company
known for being environmentally friendly,” and the percentage of those willing to pay more for
environmentally friendly products is highest among younger consumers. 176 Investment in sustainable
energy technologies also is sometimes helping companies save on costs. For example, 25% of Wal-Mart
operations are powered by renewables, and the company claims that from 2005 to 2016 its stores
reduced energy use by 20% for a total savings of $1 billion. 

Climate change as a threat to business as usual
In the agricultural sector, widespread concern that climate change threatens the supply of key
commodities such as tea, fish, and cocoa has led some of the largest firms to adopt sustainable farming
and fishing practices. Many of the world’s largest food companies believe this threat is compounded
by the risk that being seen to contribute to climate change will increasingly become a public relations
liability. 178 For example, in response to NGO accusations that they were contributing to deforestation,
McDonald’s spearheaded industry-wide efforts to preserve the Amazon rainforest; Unilever helped to
found the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil; and Kimberly Clark committed to sourcing 50% of
wood fiber from natural growth forests by 2025. 179, 180, 181 In the insurance industry, some firms, such as
Swiss Re and Prudential, have incorporated climate change into their product offerings, for example
with “pricing plans that account for potential climate impacts like storms and fires” or by declining to
offer policies for properties at risk of coastal erosion attributable to climate change. 





Some companies have responded by including a carbon price in calculations used to make
investment decisions. In 2016, 437 large companies reported using “internal carbon prices” (up from
150 in 2014) and 583 more stated that they intend to implement internal carbon pricing by 2018. 183 For
example, in 2012 Microsoft began charging individual business groups that used Microsoft services for
their carbon use; by 2014, the internal carbon price completely offset Microsoft’s energy consumption,
reducing GHG emissions by 7.5 million tons and saving the company over $10 million. One sources
suggested that “carbon is expected to converge at $140 per ton of CO2 by 2030 and $400 by 2050. In a
1.5-degree scenario, these costs would be considerably higher.” 
The increasing likelihood that the world may adopt some form of global carbon regulation may also
have significant implications for financial markets. Several observers have argued that current equity
prices reflect a “carbon bubble,” noting that if the world decides to keep atmospheric carbon
concentrations below 450 ppm, the world’s balance sheets hold energy reserves containing over twice
the amount of carbon than would be burned. They suggest that this implies that current valuations do
not take account of the threat that these assets and capital investments will be “stranded.” One bank
estimated that 40% to 60% of the current market value of the oil and gas sector may be at risk and noted
that the top 200 companies in the sector have a total market value of $4 trillion. 
Some of the largest firms in conventional energy have reacted to the threat of regulation by
attempting to discredit climate science. For example, between 2007 and 2015, ExxonMobil contributed
$1.87 million to politicians who deny climate change and an additional $454,000 to the American
Legislative Exchange Council, a corporate lobbying group that impedes efforts to fight climate
change. 187 Some accounts suggest that Charles and David Koch, whose businesses generate $100 billion
in annual revenues from fossil fuels and other related industries, have spent over $88 million to deny
the science and block regulation. 188, 189 Climate change denier organizations often follow a multipronged strategy that involves objecting to scientific data, funding seemingly academic front
organizations, promoting “scientific spokespeople,” declaring the need for more research regardless of
the consensus, and lobbying government officials to prevent regulations. 190 A Union of Concerned
Scientists report found that many of these tactics (and some of the people) were borrowed from the
tobacco industry’s earlier attempts to cast doubt on the scientific proof that smoking led to cancer. 

Mitigation and adaptation: the opportunities
Climate change also presents the private sector with a number of opportunities in mitigation and
adaptation. According to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance, in 2015 total investments in clean
energy reached a global record of $286 billion, more than six times the 2004 total. 192 New solar and
wind capacity composed about half of all new energy generation. 
In transportation, electric cars (both battery electric and plug-in hybrids) are projected to grow
rapidly in the next 25 years. In 2015, only about 550,000 new electric cars were registered worldwide,
less than 1% of the global total of 66 million passenger cars sold. 194 However, some estimates show that
in 2040, sales of electric cars would hit 41 million units, making up 35% of all light duty vehicle sales.
A key reason is that the price of electric vehicle batteries are expected to drop significantly (the learning
curve of lithium-ion batteries is about 22%); and by 2022 electric vehicles are expected to be at price
parity with conventional internal-combustion cars. 195, 196 In 2015, Tesla Motors, the leading American
electric vehicle company, had sales of only $4 billion, but its market capitalization in June of the same
year was half that of General Motors—a firm whose 2015 sales were $152 billion. 
In urban planning and infrastructure, so-called “smart city” solutions might help urban centers
reduce carbon emissions and be more energy-efficient. For example, Denmark operates district heating



schemes—essentially large boilers that produce heat for whole neighborhoods through a networks of
pipes—to reduce fuel consumption by capturing and redistributing heat that would have otherwise
been dissipated. These underground pipes also combine heat transferred from industrial factories,
incinerators, and transport systems. Such district heating solutions could help other cities significantly:
One engineering firm estimated that in London, recapturing wasted heat could power 70% of the city's
heating needs. 200 Other urban planning techniques to reduce fuel consumption include the
preservation of green space (which would help sequester GHGs) and putting homes, shops, jobs,
schools, and other destinations closer to public transportation. 
In industry and manufacturing, mitigation and adaptation opportunities can help firms save costs
and reap competitive advantages. For example, technology companies can build new server centers in
cold locations to lower cooling costs, and energy-intensive firms can consider relocating to locations
where they can access cheap utility-scale solar energy. 202 Schneider Electric, a $29 billion revenue global
energy giant, recently repositioned itself as the “global specialist in energy management,” aiming for
75% of its product revenue to be derived from products featuring its “Green Premium”TM ecolabel. 
In construction, new buildings are increasingly designed with better energy efficiency. LEED
project registrations have grown by about 2,200 registrations each quarter, even during the 2008-2009
real estate crisis. 205 The energy efficient light bulb business is now a $170+ billion industry, 206 while
Johnson Controls had 2015 revenues of over $10.5 billion in its building efficiency business. 207, 208 In
agriculture, firms that specialize in technologies to increase water supply or to increase its usage
efficiency are expecting significant market expansion. The micro-irrigation market was valued at $1.9
billion in 2013 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 17.2% from 2014 to 2019. 

Climate change is a systemic issue that has far-reaching consequences for global health, security,
and prosperity. But despite continued efforts, the world’s emissions continue to increase, and 2016 was
the hottest year on record for the third consecutive year. 210 Climate change mitigation will require a
concerted global effort to enact systemic change, and many questions remain as to what shape such an
effort should take. Should developed and developing nations be expected to participate equally in
climate change reduction? How fast should such an effort move, and where should it focus? Will
developing countries be able to leapfrog traditional energy-intensive development paths, or will they
continue to face a trade-off between growth and low-carbon development? And what role should the
private sector play in driving change?

Stabilization wedges refer to a framework for preventing approximately 200 billion tons of carbon emissions by
2060 by keeping emissions flat for the next 50 years and then reducing emissions below today’s levels in the second
half of the twenty first century. “A wedge represents a carbon-cutting strategy that has the potential to grow from
zero today to avoiding 1 billion tons of carbon emissions per year by 2060.” There are 15 strategies to cut emissions
in the electricity production, heating and direct fuel use, transportation, and biostorage sectors:


Efficiency—Transportation: One wedge could come from doubling the efficiency of all the world’s cars from
30 miles per gallon to 60 miles per gallon using hybrid and diesel technologies; increase aviation efficiency.
Challenges include car size and power.



Conservation—Transportation: One wedge could come from cutting miles traveled by all passenger and/or
freight vehicles in half by increasing public transport and enhancing urban design.


Efficiency—Buildings: One wedge could come from 25% emissions cuts in new and existing buildings by
increasing insulation, furnace, and lighting efficiency. Challenges include house size and demand for
appliances.



Efficiency—Electricity: One wedge could come from increasing the efficiency of power generation by raising
plant efficiency from 40% to 60%, although this would increase plant costs.



Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) Electricity: One wedge could come from injecting underground a volume of
CO2 every year equal to the volume extracted, or 90% of the CO2 from 800 large coal or 1,600 natural gas power
plants. The risk is the possibility of CO2 leakage.



CCS Hydrogen: One wedge could come from producing hydrogen at 10x current rates, displacing
hydrocarbon with hydrogen fuel. Challenges include new infrastructure cost and hydrogen safety.



CCS Synfuels (fuels made from non-petroleum synthetic feedstocks): One wedge could come from using CCS
at 180 large synfuels plants to capture and store CO2 emitted during production.



Fuel Switching—Electricity: One wedge could come from replacing 1,400 coal plants with natural gas plants
that would use natural gas equal to the amount used for all purposes today, making availability a challenge.



Nuclear Electricity: One wedge could come from doubling the current capacity of nuclear power, requiring
about three times the effort France put into expanding nuclear power in the 1980s, sustained for 50 years.
Challenges include weapons proliferation, nuclear waste, safety, and local opposition.



Wind Electricity: One wedge could come from using an area equal to about 3% of U.S. land area for wind
farms, adding 10x current capacity. Local opposition is a challenge.



Solar Electricity: One wedge could come from using the equivalent of a 100x 200 km PV arrays, 100x current
capacity, to displace coal-based electricity, but the challenge is PV cell materials.



Wind Hydrogen: One wedge could come from powering half the world’s cars by 2050 with hydrogen
produced using wind electricity. Challenges include local opposition, hydrogen infrastructure, and safety.



Biofuels: One wedge could come from scaling up world ethanol production by a factor of 12 to replace
petroleum fuels. However, maintaining biodiversity and competing land uses are challenges.


Forest Storage: One wedge could come from halting deforestation for 50 years, storing carbon in new forests.
However, maintaining biodiversity and competing land uses are challenges.



Soil Storage: One wedge could come from practicing carbon management on all the world’s agriculture by
using farming techniques to increase carbon retention or storage in soil. However, the risk is that this could
be reversed if the land is deep-plowed later.

Estimated LCOE (simple average of regional values) for new generation resources, for
plants entering service in 2022

EIA, August 2016, http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf, accessed December 2016.



The capacity-weighted average is the average levelized cost per technology, weighted by the new capacity coming
online in each region. The capacity additions for each region were based on additions in 2018 -2022. Technologies for
which capacity additions are not expected do not have a capacity-weighted average, and are marked as “N/B.”
The tax credit component is based on targeted federal tax credits such as the production or investment tax credit
available for some technologies. It only reflects tax credits available for plants entering service in 2022. EIA models
renewable tax credits as follows: new solar thermal and PV plants are eligible to receive a 30% investment tax credit
on capital expenditures if under construction before the end of 2019, and then tax credits taper off to 26% in 2020, 22%
in 2021, and 10% thereafter. New wind, geothermal, and biomass plants receive a $23.0/MWh ($12.0/MWh for
technologies other than wind, geothermal and closed-loop biomass) inflation-adjusted production tax credit over the
plant’s first ten years of service if they are under construction before the end of 2016, with the tax credit for wind
declining by 20% in 2017, 40% in 2018, 60% in 2019, and expiring completely in 2020. Up to 6 GW of new nuclear plants
are eligible to receive an $18/MWh production tax credit if in service by 2020. Not all technologies have tax credits,
and are indicated as “N/A.” The results are based on a regional model and state or local incentives are not included
in LCOE calculations.
Due to new regulations (CAA 111b), conventional coal plants cannot be built without CCS because they are required
to meet specific CO2 emission standards. The coal with CCS technology modeled is assumed to remove 30% of the
plant’s CO2 emissions. Coal plants have a 3 percentage-point adder to their cost-of-capital.
Costs are expressed in terms of net AC power available to the grid for the installed capacity.
As modeled, hydroelectric is assumed to have seasonal storage so that it can be dispatched within a season, but
overall operation is limited by resources available by site and season.

Proposed Timeline for the Implementation of 100% Clean and Renewable Wind, Water,
and Sunlight All-Sector Energy Roadmaps for the United States

Time-dependent change in U.S. end-use power demand for all purposes (electricity, transportation, heating/cooling,
and industry) and its supply by conventional fuels and WWS generators based on state roadmaps proposed here. Total
power demand decreases on conversion to WWS due to efficiency of electricity over combustion and end-use energy
efficiency measures. Percentages on date axis are percent conversion to WWS by that year. The percentages next to
each WWS source are final estimated penetration of the source. The 100% demarcation in 2050 indicates that 100% of
all-purpose power is provided by WWS technologies by 2050, and the power demand by that time has decreased.



For all parameters, the 10th to 90th percentile of the scenarios is shown, The ‘total range’ for the 430–480 ppm CO2eq

scenarios corresponds to the range of the 10th–90th percentile of the subcategory of these scenarios shown in Table 6.3. 2
Baseline scenarios (see SPM.3) fall into the >1000 and 720–1000ppm CO2eq categories. The latter category also includes
mitigation scenarios. The baseline scenarios in the latter category reach a temperature change of 2.5–5.8°C above preindustrial
in 2100. Together with the baseline scenarios in the >1000ppm CO2eq category, this leads to an overall 2100 temperature range
of 2.5–7.8°C (range based on median climate response: 3.7–4.8°C) for baseline scenarios across both concentration categories.
For comparison of the cumulative CO2 emissions estimates assessed here with those presented in WGI, an amount of 515 [445–
585] GtC (1890 [1630–2150] GtCO2), was already emitted by 2011 since 1870 [Section WGI 12.5]. Note that cumulative
emissions are presented here for different periods of time (2011–2050 and 2011–2100) while cumulative emissions in WGI are
presented as total compatible emissions for the RCPs (2012–2100) or for total compatible emissions for remaining below a given
temperature target with a given likelihood [WGI Table SPM, WGI SPM.E.8]. The global 2010 emissions are 31% above the
1990 emissions (consistent with the historic GHG emission estimates presented in this report). CO2eq emissions include the
basket of Kyoto gases (CO2, CH4, N2O as well as F-gases). The assessment in WGIII involves a large number of scenarios
published in the scientific literature and is thus not limited to the RCPs. To evaluate the CO2eq concentration and climate
implications of these scenarios, the MAGICC model was used in a probabilistic mode (see Annex II). For a comparison
between MAGICC model results and the outcomes of the models used in WGI, see Sections WGI 12.4.1.2 and WGI 12.4.8 and
6.3.2.6. Reasons for differences with WGI SPM Table.2 include the difference in reference year (1986–2005 vs. 1850–1900 here),
difference in reporting year (2081–2100 vs 2100 here), set-up of simulation (CMIP5 concentration driven versus MAGICC
emission-driven here), and the wider set of scenarios (RCPs versus the full set of scenarios in the WGIII AR5 scenario database
here). Temperature change is reported for the year 2100, which is not directly comparable to the equilibrium warming
reported in WGIII AR4 [Table 3.5, Chapter 3]. For the 2100 temperature estimates, the transient climate response (TCR) is the
most relevant system property. The assumed 90% range of the TCR for MAGICC is 1.2–2.6 °C (median 1.8 °C). This compares
to the 90% range of TCR between 1.2–2.4 °C for CMIP5 [WGI 9.7] and an assessed likely range of 1–2.5 °C from multiple lines
of evidence reported in the WGI AR5 [Box 12.2 in Section 12.5]. Temperature change in 2100 is provided for a median
estimate of the MAGICC calculations, which illustrates differences between the emissions pathways of the scenarios in each
category. The range of temperature change in the parentheses includes in addition the carbon cycle and climate system
uncertainties as represented by the MAGICC model [see 6.3.2.6 for further details]. The temperature data compared to the
1850–1900 reference year was calculated by taking all projected warming relative to 1986–2005, and adding 0.61 °C for 1986–
2005 compared to 1850–1900, based on HadCRUT4 [see WGI Table SPM.2]. The assessment in this table is based on the
probabilities calculated for the full ensemble of scenarios in WGIII using MAGICC and the assessment in WGI of the
uncertainty of the temperature projections not covered by climate models. The statements are therefore consistent with the
statements in WGI, which are based on the CMIP5 runs of the RCPs and the assessed uncertainties. Hence, the likelihood
statements reflect different lines of evidence from both WGs. This WGI method was also applied for scenarios with
intermediate concentration levels where no CMIP5 runs are available. The likelihood statements are indicative only [6.3], and
follow broadly the terms used by the WGI SPM for temperature projections: likely 66–100%, more likely than not >50–100%,
about as likely as not 33–66%, and unlikely 0–33%. In addition the term more unlikely than likely 0– 0–33%. In addition the
term more unlikely than likely 0–<50% is used. The CO2-equivalent concentration includes the forcing of all GHGs including
halogenated gases and tropospheric ozone, as well as aerosols and albedo change (calculated on the basis of the total forcing
from a simple carbon cycle/climate model, MAGICC). The vast majority of scenarios in this category overshoot the category
boundary of 480 ppm CO2eq concentrations. For scenarios in this category no CMIP5 run [WGI Chapter 12, Table 12.3] as
well as no MAGICC realization [6.3] stays below the respective temperature level. Still, an unlikely assignment is given to
reflect uncertainties that might not be reflected by the current climate models. 12 Scenarios in the 580–650 ppm CO2eq category
include both overshoot scenarios and scenarios that do not exceed the concentration level at the high end of the category (like
RCP4.5). The latter type of scenarios, in general, have an assessed probability of more unlikely than likely to stay below the 2
°C temperature level, while the former are mostly assessed to have an unlikely probability of staying below this level.
